# fractendpy
Python version of FracTend.m ''https://github.com/DaveHealy-github/FracTend''

Plotting functions are working but tests are not complete, work in progress. Outputs include figures and .csv file of data.

## To run the code: 
Clone the repository, navigate to the directory, and run "python fractend_run.py". This will run the code for the data file that is included 'Utah_OA-Sills'.
To run on your own data open fractend_run.py in an editor and enter your data file path, stress magnitudes, orientations,
pore fluid pressure, cohesion, etc. Then save and run "python fractend_run.py" in the command line while in the correct directory.

## To do: 

Finish tests for structural geology algorithms (sga.py) code from Cardozo and Allmendinger et al. (2012)
Finish tests for fractend
